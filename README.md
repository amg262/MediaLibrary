# Media Library Update

Fork of Jeff's MediaLibrary Application

### Things I Added / Did Differently ###

1. Made Console have logic of (M)ovie | (A)lbum |(B)ook.
2. Created logic and classes for different MediaTypes.
3. Appropriate, separate Scrubber, csv files for each MediaType.
4. Changed ```log_file.txt``` to ```error.log```.
5. ```nlog.config``` file to reflect the above changes.
6. Some other stuff :)
